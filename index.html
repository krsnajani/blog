One of the first blogs, I ever wrote was on the <i>ye old</i> Blogspot. I have had a pretty rocky road from there. I have tried to write for a sustained period on various platforms, Substack, Medium and write.as. Since then I have had time to think and contemplate, resulting in this simple and small endeavor.
</p>

<p>
I realized this. I dont need a blog to develop an alternate stream of income. I did not need this to act as a front-facing interface for <i>potential clientele</i>. This needed to primarily be a <b>public repository of knowledge and ideas</b>. As a legal academic, reading is a large part of what I do, but often fail to retain or make any logical use of the information I consume. This is merely an effort to have a public facing archive of the processing and <b><i>thinking</i></b> required to <i>digest</i> what I have read.
</p>

<p>
So. With what appears to be a firm resolve, I intend to begin this quaint blog called <b><i>'Krishna's Scratchpad on the Internet'</i></b>.
</p>

<p>
Wish me luck.
</p>

<p>
<i>Regards</i>
