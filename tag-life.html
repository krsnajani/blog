<p>
As I am discovering other people's libraries and look up videos of how to read, I am also simultaneously thinking about "WHY" should I read at all. I was looking at Jared Henderson's interesting video on the topic (<a href="https://youtu.be/2TYN3P-vTXs?si=lgLPIgouXgu6wnhw">here</a>) and he argues that reading should be understood as a 'project'. The question ultimately is 'why are you unsatisfied with the current state of your knowledge'. The answer to that in most cases for me is because I <i>could</i> be better, or that I <b>wish to feel</b> that I am knowledgeable. That maligns the intention to read. I know that it is generally a good practice (to read)  but that itself will not lead to me reading more anytime soon. I finished 2024 having read only a few books, not even hitting the double digits. That is quite embarrassing for me because I know, I have bought more than a dozen through the year.
</p>

<p>
So I keep buying and <b>collecting</b> books. I don't have a large library because I am a voracious reader, but because I like <b>collecting</b> books. That of course needs to change. I did buy these with the intention of reading them, but somehow I never end up finishing these books. I think Jared's prognosis of the issue is very apt. Reading stalls because I have no idea what to read. I have no idea what to read because I have failed to internalize <i>why</i> I should read. The general intention to 'accumulate' information is not worth pursuing. The path towards actionable, 'real' <i>knowledge</i> must come with a purpose. This is why reading for lectures though a chore is still easier to do. There is a clear list or papers that need to be read, and there is an actionable goal which is not merely the pursuit of knowledge but rather acing the semester end examination. In the presence of this identifiable goal, reading becomes armed with purpose which not only motivates but also sets the background for the act of reading. I read with a certain oeuvre if I know I am going to be tested for it.
</p>

<p>
Concluding, I think it is important create a actionable goal or purpose behind reading or generally <i>self-education</i> if you want it to have any long-term value. This does not have to be a realistic goal, they can be like Feynman's mystries; a collection of larger-than-life questions that would foreground all his investigations. The presence of a question or a purpose matters. It not only helps determine what to read, but once that choice is made, it helps maintain momentum by answering the <i>why</i> of reading.
